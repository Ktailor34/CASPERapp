# CASPERapp - Linux 

Thank you for your interest in CASPER.  Please visit the Release page to download the CASPERapp File.  While we work on debugging our packaging for Linux please see instructions below.

1) Download the ZIP File of the repository to your computer and decompress it
2) Ensure that you have at least v3.4 or Python operating on your computer
3) We have coded in a requirements file such that dependencies CASPER operates on should be automatically downloaded to your computer.
If this does not work and you have a dependency issue in step 4 please use pip or anaconda to install the appropriate packages given in
the warnings
4) Run CASPER!  Simply cd into the CASPERapp-master directory (wherever you put it) and run the command: "python3 main.py"
CASPER will launch and you will be good to go!

Any problems please email Brian Mendoza at bmendoz1@vols.utk.edu
